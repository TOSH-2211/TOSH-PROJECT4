        <h1><strong> OMOTOSHO SODIQ OLAYIWONUOLA</strong></h1>
        <p>I've always been fascinated by how platforms like Google are built and what happens behind the scenes. Even
          though I've had a strong interest in computers for a long time, I never had the chance to pursue formal
          training until my amazing brother introduced me to AltSchool Africa.
          Now, I'm excited to start this journey toward becoming a skilled frontend developer. With the help of the LMS,
          my instructors, and hands-on practice, I'm confident I'll gain the knowledge and experience I need to grow and
          thrive in tech.</p>
